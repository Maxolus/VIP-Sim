# 🎯 VIP-Sim: Visual Impairment Simulator
## 📝 Overview
VIP-Sim is a vision impairment simulator designed with the direct involvement of people with vision impairments (VIPs) to help designers better understand the visual challenges they face. Our tool allows the overlaying of 21 different visual symptoms, such as field loss and light sensitivity, on desktop design tools. It was developed through a participatory design process with N=7 VIPs and has been positively received by participants for its ability to replicate their experiences.

While VIP-Sim provides valuable insights into the lives of VIPs, some concerns remain regarding the tool's ability to fully capture the diversity of visual impairments across all users.

## 🛠️ Features
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Participatory Design: Developed with VIPs to ensure accuracy and relevance.
- 👁️ 21 Simulated Symptoms: Including light sensitivity, field loss, and more.
- 💻 Overlays on Design Tools: Seamlessly integrates with desktop design tools to simulate real-life visual challenges.
- 📦 Precompiled Versions
In the Builds folder, you will find precompiled versions of both the simulator and the assessment tool, ready for use. Simply download and get started! 🛠️✨

## 🚀 Full Release
Upon acceptance, VIP-Sim will be fully released along with this README to ensure a smooth and complete integration into your design process. We aim to foster inclusivity and improve the user experience for people with vision impairments.

### 💡 How to Use
- Navigate to the Builds folder.
- Download the compiled simulator or assessment tool.
- Follow the instructions in the tool to simulate various vision impairments.
- Alternatively, create a build yourself.

## 🎯 Goals
Foster awareness of visual impairments in design.
Enable designers to empathize with VIPs by simulating real-world challenges.
Improve accessibility across various digital platforms.
## 👥 Contributors
This project wouldn't have been possible without the active participation of our VIP collaborators. Their feedback was crucial in shaping the final product. Thank you! 🙏
